# Blog-01: The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that comes with powerful type utilities like union and intersection types, which allow developers to create much more flexible and safe code. Such features enhance code expressiveness and reduce errors by easily handling multiple data types and including different structures.

## Union Types

A **union type** allows a variable or function to accept multiple types. This flexibility is especially useful when a value can be one of several types, such as strings, numbers, or other objects. Union types enable you to write functions that can handle different kinds of inputs without losing type safety.

**Example:**

```typescript
function greet(name: string | number) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```
