# Blog-01: The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed extension of JavaScript that offers powerful type features such as union and intersection types, which allow developers to create much more flexible and safe code. Such features enhance code expressiveness and reduce errors by easily handling multiple data types and including different structures.

## Union Types

A **union type** is a type that enables a variable or function to take multiple types. This flexibility is specifically useful in the cases when the value can be one of several types - strings, numbers, or other objects. Union types let you create functions that can work with multiple kinds of inputs but without losing the type safety.

**Example:**

```typescript
function greet(name: string | number) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```

## Intersection Types

With an **intersection type**, several types are combined into one. This is helpful in those situations where a variable or object has to be of more than one type. Since different type definitions are merged, the resulting intersection types will be even more complex and comprehensive in nature, hence allowing for all properties and methods from the combined types.

**Example:**

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee {
  jobTitle: string;
  department: string;
}

type EmployeeDetails = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeeDetails = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  jobTitle: "Developer",
  department: "IT",
};
```
